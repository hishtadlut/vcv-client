        The love story between me and computers started at a very early age.
        when i was nine years old by mistake I broke my parents computer.
        I was very afraid from their response so i spend a few days to learn how to reinstall a new operating system. how to install audio drivers. grafic cards and so on.
        After this session i was realizing that even that I was so yung in computers im mach older than all the people around me.
        From this day until now I wan never stopped to learn about computers and with every new thing I learned Mmy passion to learn is gast growing.

    My favorite kind of trip is the one that you have no restricted itinerary,
    you just take your backpack with you and move around the country staying
    more or less in each place depending whether you like it or not.
